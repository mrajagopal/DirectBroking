DirectBroking
=============
This repo is a fork from ramamadhu/DirectBroking.  That was the old username that I didn't want deleted.  This still represents work I have done in this project.

1. This was an Andriod app with the purpose of viewing stock trade positions for NZX and ASX markets offered by Direct Broking Limited.

2. This was developed as a proof of concept.

3. This app is no longer functional.
